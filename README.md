## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding video tutorial. 

In this Project, I built Conversational Voice Controlled React News Application using Alan AI. Alan AI is a revolutionary speech recognition software that allows you to add voice capabilities to your applications. It allows you to control absolutely everything in the app using your voice. Another huge benefit is that it's extremely easy to integrate it. 
In this we can search any news by voice commands easily.
We have used Reactjs and materailze/ui for front-end. 

Setup for project:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` to start development server
